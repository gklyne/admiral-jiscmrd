ADMIRAL is a project of the Image Bioinformatics Research Group, Zoology Department, University of Oxford and is funded by the JISC as part of their Managing Research Data call (jiscmrd).

The purpose of the ADMIRAL Project is to create a two-tier federated data management infrastructure initially for use by life science researchers, that will provide services (a) to meet their local data management needs for the collection, digital organization, metadata annotation and controlled sharing of biological datasets; and (b) to provide an easy and secure route for archiving annotated datasets to an institutional repository for long-term preservation and access, complete with assigned Digital Object Identifiers and Creative Commons open access licences.
